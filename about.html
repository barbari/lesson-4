					<h2>Location & Geography</h2>
					<span class="text-turquoise"><i>To start with, many people mistakenly believe our island is part of the Caribbean.</i></span>
					<p>To start with, many people mistakenly believe our island is part of the Caribbean. In fact, we rest hundreds of miles north of the Bahamas in an astoundingly beautiful stretch of the Atlantic, a mere 650 miles (1,046 kilometers) east of North Carolina. Flights from New York and other eastern US cities reach our shores in less than two hours.

</p>
					<ul>
					<li>All of Bermuda fits in a cozy 21 square miles (54 sq km)</li>
					<li>We boast 75 miles (120km) of dramatic coastline</li>
					<li>Bermuda may seem like one continuous landmass to visitors, but is actually made up of 181 islands, islets and rocks. Most of these are uninhabited, but eight of the larger ones are linked by bridges and one causeway that form the subtropical paradise visitors cannot resist</li>
					<li>Our unique location in the Atlantic provides us with an extraordinarily pleasant climate that rarely sees extremes of either hot or cold.</li>
					<li>The Island’s pink beaches are actually a combination of crushed coral, calcium carbonate and the shells of tiny single-celled animals called Foraminifera</li>
